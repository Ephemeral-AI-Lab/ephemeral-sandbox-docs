# Operation Service Workspace Session Spec

Date: 2026-06-17
Status: Draft
Scope: `crates/daemon/operation_service`, operation crates, `crates/daemon/workspace`, `crates/daemon/layerstack`, `crates/daemon/core`

## Summary

This spec refines the daemon workspace ownership model for the operation-service
refactor.

The target design removes workspace policy ownership from `daemon/core`.
`daemon/core` should parse/dispatch wire requests and shape responses. It should
not preserve workspace mode, choose command/file routes, own workspace sessions,
or perform squash/remount policy.

The daemon operation layer owns workspace sessions:

```text
operation_service:
  workspace session manager
  request session lookup
  operation service collection
  maintenance policy
  squash/remount pressure trigger

operation crates:
  decide operation workflow with or without a WorkspaceSessionHandler

workspace:
  resource primitives for Host workspace, isolated-network workspace, and readonly snapshot

layerstack:
  manifests, leases, pinned layer refcounts, publish/OCC, squash/reclaim
```

## Core Decision

Workspace mode should not be preserved by the workspace crate or by
`daemon/core`.

`NetworkMode` is a workspace resource creation parameter, not persisted routing
state.

The public handle for an open workspace is `workspace_id`. The daemon should
not introduce a separate public `workspace_session_id`. If one open workspace
resource has exactly one daemon session, `workspace_id` is the stable lookup key
for that session and the session remains internal metadata.

```rust
pub enum NetworkMode {
    Host,
    Isolated,
}
```

The workspace crate provides:

```text
create_workspace(NetworkMode::Host)
create_workspace(NetworkMode::Isolated)
get_workspace_latest_snapshot(...)
capture_changes(...)
remount_workspace(...)
destroy_workspace(...)
```

The workspace crate does not decide future operation routing. It only creates,
captures, remounts, and destroys resources when asked by operation code.

## Workspace Module Contract

The workspace module provides resource handles and resource operations.

```rust
pub struct WorkspaceHandle {
    pub id: WorkspaceId,
    pub owner: CallerId,
    pub workspace_root: PathBuf,
    pub network: NetworkMode,
    pub snapshot: LayerStackSnapshotRef,
}

pub struct ReadonlySnapshotHandle {
    pub view_root: PathBuf,
    pub generation_key: String,
    pub snapshot: LayerStackSnapshotRef,
}
```

Required workspace service surface:

```rust
pub trait WorkspaceService {
    fn create_workspace(
        &self,
        request: CreateWorkspaceRequest,
    ) -> Result<WorkspaceHandle, WorkspaceError>;

    fn capture_changes(
        &self,
        handle: &WorkspaceHandle,
        request: CaptureChangesRequest,
    ) -> Result<CapturedWorkspaceChanges, WorkspaceError>;

    fn remount_workspace(
        &self,
        handle: &WorkspaceHandle,
        request: RemountWorkspaceRequest,
    ) -> Result<RemountWorkspaceResult, WorkspaceError>;

    fn destroy_workspace(
        &self,
        handle: WorkspaceHandle,
        request: DestroyWorkspaceRequest,
    ) -> Result<DestroyWorkspaceResult, WorkspaceError>;

    fn get_workspace_latest_snapshot(
        &self,
        request: LatestSnapshotRequest,
    ) -> Result<ReadonlySnapshotHandle, WorkspaceError>;
}
```

Workspace must not expose:

```text
run_command(...)
write_file_latest(...)
edit_file_latest(...)
publish_changes(...)
apply_changeset(...)
future request routing
daemon session lookup
```

## Daemon Workspace Session Contract

The daemon operation layer preserves workspace sessions.

When `enter_isolated` creates a workspace, the daemon records a
session. Later requests carry `workspace_id`; the operation layer uses that id
to resolve a handler and inject it into the operation method.

```rust
pub struct WorkspaceSession {
    pub workspace_id: WorkspaceId,
    pub caller_id: CallerId,
    pub workspace_root: PathBuf,
    pub network: NetworkMode,
    pub layer_stack_root: PathBuf,
    pub lease_id: String,
    pub snapshot: LayerStackSnapshotRef,
    pub layer_paths: Vec<PathBuf>,
    pub created_at: Timestamp,
    pub last_activity: Timestamp,
}

pub struct WorkspaceSessionHandler {
    pub workspace_id: WorkspaceId,
    pub handle: WorkspaceHandle,
    pub layer_stack_root: PathBuf,
    pub lease_id: String,
    pub snapshot: LayerStackSnapshotRef,
    pub layer_paths: Vec<PathBuf>,
}
```

Session manager state:

```rust
pub struct WorkspaceSessionManager {
    sessions: HashMap<WorkspaceId, WorkspaceSession>,
}

impl WorkspaceSessionManager {
    pub fn find_by_workspace_id(
        &self,
        workspace_id: &WorkspaceId,
    ) -> Option<&WorkspaceSession>;

    pub fn find_by_caller_id(
        &self,
        caller_id: &CallerId,
    ) -> Vec<&WorkspaceSession>;

    pub fn find_by_lease_id(
        &self,
        lease_id: &LeaseId,
    ) -> Option<&WorkspaceSession>;
}
```

The primary lookup path is `workspace_id`. Caller-keyed lookup can exist only as
a compatibility path while old clients migrate. Caller and lease lookups are
derived from the primary map in Phase 1; secondary indexes can be added later if
they become hot enough to justify the consistency burden.

### Session Manager Ownership

`operation_service` owns `WorkspaceSessionManager` through a dedicated
`WorkspaceManagerService`.

```rust
pub struct OperationServices {
    pub workspace: Arc<WorkspaceManagerService>,
    pub command: Arc<CommandOperation>,
    pub file: Arc<FileOperation>,
    pub plugin: Arc<PluginOperation>,
    pub checkpoint: Arc<CheckpointOperation>,
}

pub struct WorkspaceManagerService {
    sessions: WorkspaceSessionManager,
    workspace: Arc<dyn workspace::WorkspaceService>,
}
```

Ownership rules:

- `WorkspaceManagerService` is the only component that mutates
  `WorkspaceSessionManager`.
- `WorkspaceManagerService` wires workspace lifecycle calls that must be
  visible to daemon session tracking: create, capture, remount, and destroy.
- workspace lifecycle operations, including enter/exit isolated workspace,
  dispatch directly to `WorkspaceManagerService`.
- request dispatch asks `WorkspaceManagerService` to resolve a handler only
  when the request carries `workspace_id`.
- `command_operation` and `file_operation` receive a
  `WorkspaceSessionHandler`; they do not own the session manager.
- `command_operation` may ask `WorkspaceManagerService` to create and destroy
  an internal host workspace when it runs without an injected handler.
- `workspace` does not own sessions or routing state. It only owns resource
  primitives such as create, capture, remount, readonly snapshot, and destroy.
- `daemon/core` does not own the session manager. It parses wire requests, calls
  `operation_service`, and shapes wire responses.

Handler resolution is workspace-id based. A request with `workspace_id`
resolves to `Some(WorkspaceSessionHandler)`. A request without
`workspace_id` calls the operation method with `None`.

`None` is an explicit operation-mode input, not a daemon session. For
`command_operation`, `None` means the command operation may create its normal
one-shot `NetworkMode::Host` workspace through `WorkspaceManagerService`.
That service call registers an internal session while the command is running
and removes it when `WorkspaceManagerService::destroy` is called.
The internal workspace id is not returned to the caller as a reusable
`workspace_id`.

### Workspace Manager Service Surface

Operation code should not call raw workspace lifecycle primitives directly when
the created workspace needs session-manager visibility. It should call
`WorkspaceManagerService`, which wraps the raw workspace primitive and keeps the
session manager coherent.

Operation crates should refer to this lifecycle boundary as
`WorkspaceManagerService`. If Rust crate boundaries would otherwise create a
cycle, place `WorkspaceManagerService` and the session model in a lower-level
shared module/crate that `operation_service` composes. Do not rename the
concept to a generic lifecycle port in the public design.

```rust
pub struct CreateWorkspaceRequest {
    pub caller_id: CallerId,
    pub workspace_root: PathBuf,
    pub layer_stack_root: PathBuf,
    pub network: NetworkMode,
}

impl WorkspaceManagerService {
    pub fn create(
        &self,
        request: CreateWorkspaceRequest,
    ) -> Result<WorkspaceSessionHandler, WorkspaceManagerError> {
        todo!("service surface")
    }

    pub fn resolve(
        &self,
        workspace_id: WorkspaceId,
        caller_id: CallerId,
    ) -> Result<WorkspaceSessionHandler, WorkspaceManagerError> {
        todo!("service surface")
    }

    pub fn capture_changes(
        &self,
        handler: &WorkspaceSessionHandler,
        request: CaptureChangesRequest,
    ) -> Result<CapturedWorkspaceChanges, WorkspaceManagerError> {
        todo!("service surface")
    }

    pub fn remount_workspace(
        &self,
        handler: &WorkspaceSessionHandler,
        request: RemountWorkspaceRequest,
    ) -> Result<WorkspaceSessionHandler, WorkspaceManagerError> {
        todo!("service surface")
    }

    pub fn destroy(
        &self,
        handler: WorkspaceSessionHandler,
        request: DestroyWorkspaceRequest,
    ) -> Result<DestroyWorkspaceResult, WorkspaceManagerError> {
        todo!("service surface")
    }
}
```

`command_operation` stores `WorkspaceManagerService` and uses it only when it
owns a lifecycle flow, such as the no-session host one-shot path:

```rust
pub struct CommandOperation {
    workspace: Arc<WorkspaceManagerService>,
}
```

`WorkspaceManagerService::create` calls
`workspace.create_workspace(...)`, then inserts a `WorkspaceSession` into
`WorkspaceSessionManager` before returning the handler. The operation decides
whether the returned `workspace_id` is exposed to the caller:

- `enter_isolated` returns the `workspace_id` to the caller.
- one-shot command execution keeps the handler internal and destroys it before
  returning the command result.
- workspace-run end/cancel-all routes are handled by `WorkspaceManagerService`;
  there is no separate run service.

If session insertion fails, the service must destroy or schedule cleanup for
the raw workspace before returning the error.

`WorkspaceManagerService::destroy` marks the session closing, calls
`workspace.destroy_workspace(...)`, releases the associated lease, and removes
the session from `WorkspaceSessionManager`. If destroy fails, the service must
leave enough session manager state to retry or report the leaked resource; it must not
silently remove a live workspace.

`WorkspaceManagerService::capture_changes` and
`WorkspaceManagerService::remount_workspace` call the corresponding workspace
primitive and update session metadata such as `last_activity`, `snapshot`,
`layer_paths`, and lease ids as needed. Later live-remount phases should add
explicit remount state when they define the transition policy.

Raw `workspace.create_workspace(...)` remains a primitive and does not
auto-register anything by itself. The automatic session-manager mutation
belongs to the service wrapper.

## Operation Service Layout Plan

The operation-service crate should use domain folders instead of a generic
`ops/` folder. Each domain folder owns one service boundary and focused
implementation files.

```text
crates/daemon/operation_service/src/
  lib.rs
  services.rs
  dispatch.rs
  error.rs

  workspace/
    mod.rs
    service.rs        # WorkspaceManagerService
    session_manager.rs # WorkspaceSession, handler, session map
    error.rs

  command/
    mod.rs
    service.rs        # CommandOperationService
    exec.rs
    lifecycle.rs
    remount.rs

  file/
    mod.rs
    service.rs        # FileOperationService
    read.rs
    write.rs
    edit.rs

  checkpoint/
    mod.rs
    service.rs        # CheckpointOperationService

  plugin/
    mod.rs
    service.rs        # PluginOperationService
```

There is no separate `run/` service and no separate isolated-network operation
service. Workspace-run end/cancel-all, isolated enter/exit, session recovery,
and live remount coordination belong to `workspace/service.rs`
(`WorkspaceManagerService`).

The workspace crate keeps its own lower-level service boundary:

```text
crates/daemon/workspace/src/service.rs
  pub trait WorkspaceService
```

`workspace::WorkspaceService` is resource-facing: create, capture, remount,
destroy, and latest-snapshot primitives only. It must not own daemon sessions,
operation routing, caller/session lookup, command liveness policy, or run
teardown. Recovery, persistence, pressure, and live-remount maintenance modules
should be added only in the later phases that implement those behaviors.

## Request Flow

### Enter Isolated Workspace

```text
request: enter_isolated(caller_id, workspace_root)

operation_service:
  resolve workspace_root and layer_stack_root
  call WorkspaceManagerService::create(NetworkMode::Isolated)
  return workspace_id
```

`enter_isolated` is a workspace lifecycle route. It is not a separate
operation service; it creates an isolated workspace by calling
`WorkspaceManagerService::create` with `NetworkMode::Isolated`. Normal
command/file operations must not create isolated sessions implicitly.

### Later Operation With Session

```text
request: exec_command(..., workspace_id)

operation_service:
  resolve WorkspaceSession
  validate caller owns session
  build WorkspaceSessionHandler
  call command_operation with handler

command_operation:
  sees handler.network == NetworkMode::Isolated
  runs command in existing workspace
  does not create one-shot workspace
  does not destroy isolated-network workspace
```

The same model applies to file operations:

```text
write_file(..., workspace_id)
  -> file_operation writes into mounted workspace upperdir
  -> no implicit publish
  -> no implicit destroy
```

### Later Operation Without Workspace Id

```text
request: exec_command(..., no workspace_id)

operation_service:
  call command_operation.exec_command(input, None)

command_operation:
  sees None
  calls WorkspaceManagerService::create(NetworkMode::Host)
    when needed
  runs command
  calls WorkspaceManagerService::capture_changes(...)
  publishes according to command policy
  calls WorkspaceManagerService::destroy(...)
```

This is intentionally different from the session path. A provided handler means
the operation must use an existing session workspace and must not create or
destroy it. A missing handler means `command_operation` is free to run its
ordinary host one-shot workflow, but that workflow must use
`WorkspaceManagerService` so the temporary workspace is tracked while it
exists.

For targeted file operations without a session:

```text
write_file(..., no workspace_id)

file_operation:
  get readonly latest snapshot
  compute LayerChange
  publish through layerstack.publish_to_layer_stack
  no mounted workspace creation required
```

## Operation Method Shape

Rust does not support method overloading by signature. The target design uses
one method with an optional handler:

```rust
impl CommandOperation {
    pub fn exec_command(
        &self,
        input: ExecCommandInput,
        workspace: Option<WorkspaceSessionHandler>,
    ) -> Result<CommandOutcome, CommandError>;
}
```

The same shape should be used for file/plugin/checkpoint methods that can
operate against either a resolved workspace handler or a latest-snapshot
workflow:

```rust
impl FileOperation {
    pub fn write_file(
        &self,
        input: WriteFileInput,
        workspace: Option<WorkspaceSessionHandler>,
    ) -> Result<FileOperationOutcome, FileOperationError>;
}
```

Semantics:

- request dispatch resolves and injects `Some(handler)` only when the request
  carries `workspace_id`.
- `Some(handler)` means the operation must use the provided workspace and must
  not create or destroy a workspace internally.
- `Some(handler)` is a persisted workspace session, typically created by
  `enter_isolated`.
- `None` for `command_operation` means the command operation owns its normal
  one-shot `NetworkMode::Host` workspace lifecycle through
  `WorkspaceManagerService`.
- `None` for targeted file operations can mean a non-mounted workflow such as
  readonly latest snapshot plus direct layer publish.
- explicit lifecycle operations, such as `enter_isolated` and
  `exit_isolated`, are the only operations that create or destroy
  persisted isolated-network workspace sessions.

## Exit Isolated Workspace

```text
request: exit_isolated(workspace_id, grace_s)

operation_service:
  resolve session
  coordinate command cancellation or active-command rejection policy
  call WorkspaceManagerService::destroy(handle)
  return destroy report
```

`exit_isolated` is a workspace lifecycle route. It is not a separate
operation service; it destroys an isolated workspace by calling
`WorkspaceManagerService::destroy`. Exit discards the isolated-network
workspace upperdir by default. It must not publish implicitly.

Destroy responsibility belongs to the explicit exit operation, not to ordinary
command/file operations that merely receive a `WorkspaceSessionHandler`.

## Squash And Pinned Layer Tracking

There are two registries with different jobs.

Daemon session manager:

```text
Which workspace sessions are open?
Which caller owns each session?
Which workspace handle belongs to the session?
Which LayerStack lease id backs the session?
Which active commands are bound to the session?
Is the session active, remount_pending, or closing?
```

LayerStack lease registry:

```text
Which lease ids are active?
Which manifest is leased by each lease id?
Which LayerRef values are pinned?
What is the refcount for each pinned LayerRef?
```

LayerStack is the authority for pinned layers. Daemon sessions are the authority
for mapping those leases back to open workspaces and callers.

Target relation:

```text
WorkspaceSession.workspace_id
  -> WorkspaceSession.lease_id
  -> LayerStack lease manifest
  -> pinned LayerRef set
```

LayerStack must not rely on daemon session state to decide whether a layer can
be deleted. It should delete only layers not referenced by active lease
refcounts.

The daemon uses `WorkspaceSessionManager::find_by_lease_id` to explain pressure
and to trigger live remount:

```rust
sessions.find_by_lease_id(&lease_id) -> Option<&WorkspaceSession>
```

## Squash Policy Flow

```text
on publish/finalize/maintenance:
  metrics = layerstack.storage_metrics()
  pressure = layerstack.lease_pressure()

  if depth and bytes are below thresholds:
      return

  ordinary_reclaim = layerstack.reclaim_unpinned_gaps()

  for each blocking lease from pressure:
      if lease maps to open WorkspaceSession:
          ask WorkspaceManagerService to attempt live remount
      else:
          keep hard protection; report orphan or stale lease pressure
```

Live remount is not a workspace mode. It is a transient maintenance state on an
existing daemon workspace session:

```rust
pub enum RemountState {
    Active,
    Pending,
    Closing,
}
```

Live remount flow:

```text
operation_service:
  select pressured session
  mark session remount_pending

command_operation:
  verify active commands are isolated and remountable
  quiesce process groups
  inspect cwd/root/fd/mmap/mountinfo

layerstack:
  build compact mounted-snapshot or leased-parent manifest

workspace:
  remount existing workspace with compact lowerdir list
  verify mountinfo lowerdir state

layerstack:
  retarget lease only after mount verification
  run squash/reclaim cleanup

operation_service:
  update WorkspaceSession snapshot/layer_paths/remount_state
  resume commands
  clear remount_pending
```

Required invariants:

- Never retarget a lease before workspace mount verification succeeds.
- Never delete lowerdirs referenced by the old lease until retarget succeeds.
- Always resume quiesced commands on success, failure, or early return.
- Treat unknown process inspection state as blocked.
- Keep `remount_pending` visible in the session manager so concurrent
  operations can reject, wait, or route according to operation policy.
- On daemon restart, reload sessions, verify holder/mount/lease state, and
  either recover the session or destroy the workspace and release the lease.

## Dependency Rules

Target dependency direction:

```text
daemon/core -> operation_service

operation_service -> command_operation
operation_service -> file_operation
operation_service -> plugin_operation
operation_service -> checkpoint_operation
operation_service -> WorkspaceManagerService

command_operation -> WorkspaceManagerService
command_operation -> layerstack publish port

file_operation -> WorkspaceManagerService
file_operation -> workspace readonly snapshot port
file_operation -> layerstack publish/read ports

WorkspaceManagerService -> workspace
WorkspaceManagerService -> layerstack lease/session ports
WorkspaceManagerService -> command_operation liveness/cancel/remount port
WorkspaceManagerService -> layerstack remount/squash port

workspace -> layerstack snapshot/lease/view setup

layerstack -> workspace forbidden
layerstack -> operation_service forbidden
layerstack -> operation crates forbidden
```

If these arrows would form a Rust crate cycle, split `WorkspaceManagerService`
and its session model into a lower-level crate/module used by
`operation_service` and operation crates. The design name remains
`WorkspaceManagerService`.

`daemon/core` must not depend on old `operation`, `command`, `plugin`, or
`plugin-contract` once the operation-service split is complete.

## Migration Notes

1. Add `crates/daemon/operation_service` with the domain-folder layout above.
2. Keep `crates/daemon/workspace/src/service.rs` as the low-level
   `workspace::WorkspaceService` resource boundary.
3. Move session/routing policy out of `daemon/core`.
4. Use `workspace_id` in request contracts where open-workspace binding is
   needed.
5. Return `workspace_id` from `enter_isolated`.
6. Make operation methods accept optional or explicit `WorkspaceSessionHandler`.
7. Route tracked workspace create/capture/remount/destroy through
   `WorkspaceManagerService` instead of raw workspace service calls.
8. Move workspace-run teardown and live remount orchestration into
   `WorkspaceManagerService`.
9. Keep LayerStack as the source of truth for pinned layer refs.
10. Retire `WorkspaceRuntime` from `daemon/core`.

## Open Questions

- Should ordinary operations reject missing `workspace_id` when the
  caller owns an active isolated session, or should caller-keyed compatibility
  routing remain during migration?
- Should `exit_isolated` cancel active commands by default, or reject
  while commands are active unless `force` is provided?
- Should live remount use full snapshot compaction or leased-head plus
  compact-parent compaction as the default production representation?
